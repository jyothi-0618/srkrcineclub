        <h2 style="text-align:center;color:white;">Poetry</h2>
    <div class="desc">A poem is a piece of literature that makes use of rhythmic qualities of language, such as phonesthetics, sound symbolism, and meter to convey meaning. Phonesthetics examines the aesthetic appeal of the sounds of certain words or parts of words. Sound symbolism refers to the non-arbitrary relationship between the sounds of speech and their meaning. A meter is the fundamental rhythmic structure of a poem or lines of poetry.<br>
      
      Epic: Epics are long-verse narratives retelling the heroic journey of an individual or a group of individuals. An epic typically features superhuman feats, extraordinary adventures, highly stylized language, and a combination of lyrical and dramatic elements.<br>
      Narrative: A narrative poem tells a story through poetic techniques, such as rhyme, rhythm, similes, and metaphors. Narrative poems are longer than other forms of poetry and contain a complete story similar to a novel.<br>
      Lyric: Lyric poems are short, highly musical verses that express powerful emotions. A lyric poem is a personal expression of emotion written by a single individual.<br>
      Dramatic: Dramatic poetry is poetry that's written in verse for public recitation or performance. The purpose of dramatic poetry is often to express one's thoughts aloud to another actor, oneself, or an audience.</div>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;color:white;">>Fiction</h2>
    <div class="desc">
      There are several purposes for fiction, including entertaining, inspiring, informing, and persuading the audience.
      Mystery: Mystery novels provide readers with plots that explore mysteries from beginning to end. One of the main characters in a mystery is typically a detective or a private investigator who solves the mystery with the reader.<br>
      Historical fiction: Historical fiction uses real-life events to support its plots and key details. A work of historical fiction engages readers by retelling a historical event in creative ways that alter minor details, such as characters' names or the setting.<br>
      Fantasy: Mythology and ancient folklore are some sources of inspiration for fantasy novels. Fantasy novels usually depict imaginary settings, beings, and universes that are nonexistent in the real world.<br>
      Romance: Love stories are the dominant theme of romance novels. Although romance is also a prominent element of other forms of fiction, romance novels emphasize the development of a romantic relationship.<br>
      Science fiction: There are several themes that are characteristic of science fiction, including space exploration, futuristic species, and time travel. Most of the stories revolve around scientific concepts, such as physics, astronomy, anthropology, chemistry, and astrophysics.<br>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;color:white;">Nonfiction</h2>
    <div class="desc">
      Nonfiction writing aims to inform or inspire the audience by using actual events, people, places, or facts. Students can gain a deeper understanding of fiction texts through nonfiction texts, such as textbooks and essays. Before writing a nonfiction piece, nonfiction authors typically conduct extensive research. Here are a few of the subgenres of nonfiction literature:<br>
      Autobiography: An autobiography is a personal narrative of one's life. Autobiographies may serve a variety of purposes, such as helping the author overcome a difficult situation, assisting people in overcoming similar challenges, or simply conveying stories.<br>
Biography: A biography is an account of a person's life, written by someone else. Many biographies feature notable individuals, such as celebrities, athletes, business leaders, and politicians.<br>
Essay: An essay is a short piece of writing in which the author elaborates on an idea or topic after conducting thorough research. An essay may aim to engage its readers, influence their thinking, get them involved in its ideas, or persuade them to adopt the same point of view.<br>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;color:white;">  Drama</h2>
    <div class="desc">
      Dramas are representations of fiction that involve dialogue and performance.<br>

      Exposition: Set up and introduce everything through exposition, which lays out the background information of your story. Outline the main characters, setting, and time period. One way to get through exposition in your screenplay is to have at least one curious character act as a proxy for the audience: That character can ask questions that the audience might have, thus clarifying various plot points.<br>
      Rising action: Introduce the story’s main conflict with the rising action, which are a series of events in the story that create tension and build to the climax. For example, in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the rising action happens when Hamlet’s father’s ghost tells Hamlet that Claudius murdered him. Hamlet’s intention becomes clear—to avenge his father’s death—and the story begins.
      Climax: Build to the height of tension, and reach the turning point for the main character. Usually, the climax of a story takes place when the main character has to face the truth and make an important choice.<br>
      Conclusion: Close the loop on the story. Show how the tension affected the characters and the world around them.<br>

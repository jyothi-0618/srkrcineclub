    <div class="desc">Manipuri dance emerged in Manipur in north-eastern India, and is rooted in the Vaishnava beliefs of the Meiteis, or Manipur valley people. Manipur’s dance is divided into two sections: jagoi and cholom, which match to the lasya and tandava parts mentioned in Sanskrit literature. These are distinct streams, and an artist can spend a lifetime honing any form within the spectrum. </div>
